# Go Arch Benchmarks

!WIP!

This project is used to create benchmarks for different architecture stacks.

Whether you use the go std http server or fasthttp, plain SQL or an ORM, REST or GraphQL, simple architecture or clean architecture.

All based on the same application logic.

This project should show, when to use which architecture/tech stack.
